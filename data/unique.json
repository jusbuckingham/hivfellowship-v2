  "bullets": [
    "Our program is flexible to meet trainees’ interests from varying clinical backgrounds. We are excited to welcome fellows coming out of physician residency training programs in Internal Medicine, Med/Peds, and Family Medicine, or infectious diseases fellowships",
    "Our program offers an exclusive focus on HIV and tuberculosis care. In their primary HIV clinic, fellows will only follow PWH, individuals enrolling in PrEP, and individuals seeking hepatitis C treatment. Many HIV training programs are based in general primary care clinical settings. This program is based in a Ryan White HIV clinic, so fellows will exclusively provide HIV and TB‐related care",
    "Our HIV clinic is a large, comprehensive, multidisciplinary care center. We care for over 2,000 PWH and provide primary care for the majority of those patients",
    "The RISE TB Clinic is unique in providing care for nearly all individuals with tuberculosis and latent TB in Rhode Island, giving fellows a unique state‐wide perspective",
    "The HIV faculty are nationally and internationally known. Fellows have the opportunity for clinical learning from national experts, professional development, engagement in research opportunities, and building connections for the future.",
    "Funding support is available for conferences, CME, and the AAHIVM Specialist exam",
    "Our patients are wonderful!"
